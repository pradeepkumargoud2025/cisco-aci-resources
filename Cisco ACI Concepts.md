🌐 1. Fabric

Definition: The ACI fabric is the entire network infrastructure (spine, leaf, APIC, endpoints).
Purpose: Provides high-performance, scalable, automated connectivity.

Components:
* Leaf switches: Connect to endpoints (servers, routers, firewalls)
* Spine switches: Connect only to leafs (no spine-to-spine or leaf-to-leaf)
* APICs: Centralized management & policy control

🧠 2. APIC (Application Policy Infrastructure Controller)

Definition: The brain of the ACI fabric, controlling policies, configurations, and monitoring.
Cluster: Usually 3 or more nodes for HA.

Functions:

* Policy management
* Fabric discovery
* Health monitoring
* Integration with orchestration tools (vCenter, OpenStack, Kubernetes)

🧩 3. Cluster

Definition: An APIC Cluster refers to a group of Cisco APIC devices that work together to manage and control a Cisco ACI fabric.
Purpose: Redundancy, scalability, fault tolerance.

🏗️ 4. POD (Point of Delivery)

Definition: One independent ACI fabric (spine + leaf + APICs).
Purpose: Scalability, resiliency, multi-location deployments.

## Multi-POD ##

Definition: Multiple PODs under one APIC cluster connected via IPN (Inter-POD Network).
Benefits: Centralized management, fault isolation, disaster recovery.

🧱 5. Bridge Domain (BD)

Definition: Layer 2 forwarding domain, like a VLAN.
Purpose: Connects EPGs; endpoints in same BD communicate at L2.

L3 Capability:
* Associate BD with VRF
* Configure Subnet/Gateway
* Now BD can route traffic (acts like an SVI)

## BD Modes Comparison ##

| Mode  | Subnet | VRF   | Routing | Use Case                   |
| ----- | ------ | ----- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| L2 BD | ❌ No   | ❌ No  | ❌ No    | Same-subnet communication  |
| L3 BD | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes   | Inter-subnet communication |


🧩 6. Endpoint Group (EPG)

Definition: Logical group of endpoints sharing policies.
Purpose: Define traffic rules between groups.

Example: Web EPG ↔ DB EPG

🏢 7. Tenant

Definition: Logical container holding policies, BDs, EPGs, VRFs.
Purpose: Segmentation of applications or environments.

Types:
* Infrastructure Tenant (system)
* Common Tenant (shared)
* User-defined Tenant (apps, Prod/Dev/Testing)

🌍 8. VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding)

Definition: Layer 3 routing domain, isolates traffic.
Purpose: Keeps tenants/applications separate.

🔄 9. Contract

Definition: Policy defining communication rules between EPGs.
Contains: Filters (TCP/80, ICMP), Actions (permit/deny).

☁️ 10. Orchestration

Definition: Integration with external automation tools (vCenter, OpenStack, Kubernetes).
Purpose: Automates network provisioning for dynamic workloads.

🧭 11. Policy Model

ACI is policy-driven:
Define intent → APIC translates to configurations automatically

⚙️ 12. Fabric Discovery

Automatic detection of leaf/spine switches via LLDP.
Simplifies topology setup.

📡 13. Access Policy

Defines how endpoints connect to leaf switches (interface policies, profiles).
